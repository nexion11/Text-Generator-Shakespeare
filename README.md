# Text-Generator-Shakespeare
This is a text generator model built to generate Shakespeare poetry text. It has only been trained on 20 epcohs, meaning that it is not the most accurate and quite a bit of the text will be senseless. IF you were to save the model and retrain it with, per say, 50 epochs, it would heed significantly more accurate results.
